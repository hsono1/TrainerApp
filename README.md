# TrainerApp
Project under construction. This Web application is being done using MVC architecture in MEAN stack. 

TrainerApp will let clients and personal trainers interact. Trainers can set custom sessions to their clients and control their performance. 
On the other hand, clients are able to see their personal sessions like diet, exercises, etc. while updating constantly their progress.
